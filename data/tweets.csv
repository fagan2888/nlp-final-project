$AAPL I think it’s in between, I wouldn’t be surprised to see $160 or even $150 this Spring if earnings disappoint, but again, they’ll be buying A TON if that happens!","Paul Bratby Official

I think energy and something to do with EV charging.  I hold $ENPH in my LT porfolio.  I think it will be huge.  I actually had it in the 5's and sold.  I bought back in at $20
  An EV charging like $BLNK.  Then there's $AMD, I think thats def going big.

Dear 
@LisaSu
 and 
@AMD
..
My dream is to contribute to the growth and success of the AMD brand and product lineup. I made a mistake a few years ago by turning down an AMD offer (for investment banking, no less 
). The feeling of regret still stings.

One lesson from $INTC's earnings report: Its battle with $AMD (though definitely mattering) isn't the only thing to look at when evaluating a company this big and diversified.
