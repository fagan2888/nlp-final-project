$AAPL & $FB are in serious trouble. Both companies need to seriously reconsider the business model... neither are sustainable for long.,,And in other news from the fecking obvious department - the sun rose again today.
$SPX - Believe a top (short term) has been reached.  A lot of key stocks are at expected tops. $AAPL + $AMZN has begun to fall (may lead the way for others to follow). Dollar broke below key resistance today and $GOLD broke above multi  - market downturn will lead to breakout.,,"Dr. Alexandre Mannette? Tactical Versus Strategic. Whoa Baby.
