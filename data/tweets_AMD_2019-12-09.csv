AMD,2019-12-09,"Exited. Got in at a decent time, but this morning’s run up killed my puts - was down 54%. I ended up selling for 20% profit, so no complaints. $AMD was $40.02 at my entry, $39.11 at exit - 2.3% drop in less than 2 full trading days. This has more room down, but playing it safe.",0,0,1
